Compilation
-----------
Pre-compiled JARs are available in [Releases](https://github.com/KevinDaGame/VoxelSniper/releases).
Alternatively, you can compile the project yourself using Gradle.
We strongly recommend that you use Intellij to compile the project.

Other methods of compiling are at your own risk.

Issue Tracker Notes
-------------------
How do I create a ticket the right way?

- Seperate your reports. You think there is something wrong, but also want this new brush? Make life easier for us and create two tickets. We'd appreciate it big time.
- Don't tell us your story of life. We want facts and information. The more information about `the Problem` you give us, the easier it is for us to figure out what's wrong.
- Check the closed tickets first. Maybe someone created a similiar ticket already. If you think it's unresolved, then give us more information on there instead.
- Use the correct teplates. Bug reports and feature requests have their own respective templates. If your issue does not fit within those, then use the other template

Keep in mind that those are guidelines.
We may still look into stuff that does not follow these guidlines, but it will take more effort on our end and will reduce the likelyhood of us handling it.

Pull Requests
-------------
We accept pull requests and enhancements from third parties.

Here are some guidelines for pull requests:

- Keep the number of commits to a minimum. We want to look over the commit and easily see what you've done.
- Give us a good description to what you've done.
- Try to submit one change in one pull request and try to link it to the issue in the tracker if possible.
- Code should be formatted using the intellij formatter to insure a consistent style throughout the project
